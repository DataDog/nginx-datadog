  # `agent` is a mock trace agent.  It listens on port 8126, accepts msgpack,
  # decodes the resulting traces, and prints them to standard output as JSON.
  # You can inspect traces sent to the agent (e.g. from the nginx module)
  # by looking at `agent` log lines in the output of `docker-compose up`.

  # `http` is an HTTP server that is reverse proxied by `nginx`.  It listens
  # on port 8080 and responds with a JSON object containing the name of
  # the service ("http") and the request's HTTP headers.  This way, you can
  # see which trace context, if any, was propagated to the reverse proxied
  # server.

  # `fastcgi` is a FastCGI server that is reverse proxied by `nginx`.  It
  # listens on port 8080 and responds with a JSON object containing the name of

  # which trace context, if any, was propagated to the reverse proxied server.

  # `grpc` is a gRPC server that is reverse proxied by `nginx`.  It
  # listens on port 1337 and responds with a message containing the metadata
  # sent with the request.  This way, you can see
  # which trace context, if any, was propagated to the reverse proxied server.
  # gRPC requests are made to nginx using `grpcurl`, which is included in the
  # `nginx` container image.

  # `client` is a container that exists solely so that you can `docker-compose
  # exec` into it to run command line tools such as `curl` and `grpcurl`.  This
  # way, the host's network doesn't need access to the network created by
  # docker-compose.  You can interact with the docker-compose services via
  # `docker-compose` and `docker` commands only.
