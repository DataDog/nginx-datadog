# This script is a wrapper around "curl".
#
# It passes its command line arguments to "curl," but has the following
# additional behavior:
#
# - The progress meter is suppressed.
# - The first line of standard output is the JSON object produced by the
#   "--write-out ${json}" option.
# - The second line of standard input is the response body represented as
#   a JSON string, i.e. double quoted and with escape sequences.
#
# The intention is that the test driver invoke this script using
# `docker-compose exec`.  The output format is chosen to be easy to parse in
# Python.
