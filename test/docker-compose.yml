  # decodes the resulting traces, and prints them to standard output as JSON.
  # The tests can inspect traces sent to the agent (e.g. from the nginx module)
  # by looking at `agent` log lines in the output of `docker compose up`.

  # `client` is a container that exists solely so that the test runner can
  # `docker compose exec` into it to run command line tools such as `curl` and
  # `grpcurl`.  This way, the test runner's network doesn't need access to the
  # network created by docker compose.  The test runner interacts with the
  # docker compose services via `docker compose` and `docker` commands only.
  # This became necessary when these tests were integrated into CircleCI --
  # CircleCI's container-based remote-docker docker compose setup does not
  # allow a host port binding.
