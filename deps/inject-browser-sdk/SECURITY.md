# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for the RUM browser injection module and what to do if you discover a security vulnerability in the project.
Most notably, please do not share the details in a public forum (such as in a discussion, issue, or pull request) but instead reach out to us with the details.
This gives us an opportunity to release a fix for others to benefit from by the time details are made public.


## Supported Versions

We accept vulnerability submissions for any currently maintained versions of any of the webservers/proxies supported.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability please submit details to the following email address:
