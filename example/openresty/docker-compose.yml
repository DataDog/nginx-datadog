  # `client` is a container that exists solely so that the host can
  # `docker-compose exec` into it to run command line tools such as `curl` and
  # `grpcurl`.  This way, the host's network doesn't need access to the network
  # created by docker-compose.  The host interacts with the docker-compose
  # services via `docker-compose` and `docker` commands only.
