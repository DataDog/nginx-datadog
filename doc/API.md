Configuring Datadog Tracing in Nginx
====================================
The behavior of the Datadog nginx module can be customized using dedicated
directives in the nginx configuration.

Nginx configuration files have a hierarchical structure:
```nginx
# "main" context

events {
    # ...
}

http {
    # "http" context

    server {
        # "server" context
        listen 80;

        location /ping {
            # "location" context
            # ...
        }

        location /auth {
            if ($request_method = POST) {
                # "if" context
                # ...
            }
            # ...
        }
    }
}
```
Each context inherits its configuration from the surrounding context.  Contexts
closer to the "main" context are at a "higher level," and contexts more deeply
nested are at a "lower level."

For example, in the configuration above, `location /ping` inherits all of its
configuration from the surrounding `server`, which in turn inherits its
configuration from the surrounding "main" context.

Configuration directives in a given context override part of the configuration
inherited from the higher levels.

Configuration Directives
========================
The Datadog tracing module defines the following configuration directives.

### `datadog_service_name`
- **syntax** `datadog_service_name <name>`
- **default**: `nginx`
- **context**: `http`

Set the service name to associate with each span produced by this module.

### `datadog_environment`
- **syntax** `datadog_environment <environment>`
- **default**: (no value)
- **context**: `http`

Set the name of the environment within which nginx is running. Common values
include `prod`, `dev`, and `staging`.

### `datadog_sample_rate`
- **syntax** `datadog_sample_rate <rate> [on|off]`
- **default**: N/A
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Set the probability that the traces beginning with requests in this
configuration context will be kept (sent to Datadog), as opposed to dropped.

The `<rate>` is a number between 0.0 and 1.0, inclusive. Zero indicates "never,"
while one indicates "always." `0.5` would indicate "half the time," i.e. 50%.

Optionally specify a third argument that is a variable expression that must
evaluate to either `on` or `off`.  If it evaluates to `on`, then the associated
sample rate is chosen.  If it evaluates to `off`, then the associated sample
rate is ignored. Any other value behaves as `off` and logs an error. If the
third argument is omitted, then it defaults to `on`.

`datadog_sample_rate` directives in lower level configuration contexts take
precedence over those in higher level configuration contexts. If multiple
directives appear at the same configuration level, then their `on`/`off`
expressions are tried in order.  The first directive whose expression evaluates
to `on` is the rate applied at that configuration level.

For example, consider the following excerpt from an nginx configuration file:
```nginx
 1  http {
 2      map $http_x_request_category $healthcheck_toggle {
 3          healthcheck    on;
 4          default    off;
 5      }
 6
 7      datadog_sample_rate 0 $healthcheck_toggle;
 8      datadog_sample_rate 0.1;
 9
10      server {
11          listen 80;
12
13          location / {
14              proxy_pass http://upstream;
15          }
16
17          location /admin {
18              datadog_sample_rate 1.0;
19              proxy_pass http://admin-portal;
20          }
21      }
22  }
```

The `location /` at line 13 does not have its own `datadog_sample_rate`, so it
inherits any from enclosing configuration contexts.  There are no
`datadog_sample_rate` directives directly in the enclosing `server` block, but
there are in the enclosing `http` block. The first is on line 7, and is
conditional based on the value of the `$healthcheck_toggle` variable, which is
defined by the `map` on line 2.

A request that routes to `location /` will be sampled at 0% if the
`X-Request-Category` header has the value `healthcheck`, per the
`datadog_sample_rate` on line 7. If the `X-Request-Category` header is no
present or has a value different from `healthcheck`, then the request will be
sampled at 10%, per the `datadog_sample_rate` on line 8.

A request that routes to `location /admin` will be sampled at 100%, per the
`datadog_sample_rate` on line 18.

The `datadog_sample_rate` directive that applies, if any, is annotated in the
request span as the `nginx.sample_rate_source` tag. The tag has the following
format:
```
<nginx file path>:<line>#<dupe>
```
For example,
```
/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:23#1
```
- `<nginx file path>` is the path to the nginx configuration file that contains
  the `datadog_sample_rate` directive.
- `<line>` is the line number where the directive appears.
- `<dupe>` is the one-based index of the directive among all
  `datadog_sample_rate` directives that appear on that same line. Typically each
  directive is on its own line, so `<dupe>` is likely always `1`.

### `datadog_agent_url`
- **syntax** `datadog_agent_url <url>`
- **default**: `http://localhost:8126`
- **context**: `http`

Specify a URL at which the Datadog Agent can be contacted.
The following formats are supported:

- `http://<domain or IP>:<port>`
- `http://<domain or IP>`
- `http+unix://<path to socket>`
- `unix://<path to socket>`

The port defaults to 8126 if it is not specified.

### `datadog_tag`
- **syntax** `datadog_tag <key> <value>`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

On the currently active span, set a tag whose name is the specified `<key>` and
whose value is the result of evaluating the specified `<value>` in the context
of the current request.  `<value>` is a string that may contain
`$`-[variables][2] (including those provided by this module).

### `datadog_delegate_sampling`
- **syntax** `datadog_delegate_sampling [on|off]`
- **default** `off`
- **context** `http`, `server`, `location`

If `on`, and if nginx is making the trace sampling decision (i.e. if nginx is
the first service in the trace), then delegate the sampling decision to the
upstream service.  nginx will make a provisional sampling decision, and convey
it along with the intention to delegate to the upstream. The upstream service
might then make its own sampling decision and convey that decision back in the
response. If the upstream does so, then nginx will use the upstream's sampling
decision instead of the provisional decision.

Sampling delegation exists to allow nginx to act as a reverse proxy for multiple
different services, where the trace sampling decision can be better made within
the service than it can within nginx.

Sampling delegation is `off` by default. The directive's argument can be a
variable expression that evaluates to either of `on` or `off`. If the
directive's argument is omitted, then it is as if it were `on`.

### `datadog_enable`
- **syntax** `datadog_enable`
- **context** `http`, `server`, `location`

Enable Datadog tracing in the current configuration context.  This overrides
any `datadog_disable` directives at higher levels, and may be overridden by
`datadog_disable` directives at lower levels.

When tracing is enabled, a span is created for each request, and trace context
is propagated to the proxied service.

Datadog tracing is enabled by default.

### `datadog_disable`
- **syntax** `datadog_disable`
- **context** `http`, `server`, `location`

Disable Datadog tracing in the current configuration context.  This overrides
any `datadog_enable` directives at higher levels, and may be overridden by
`datadog_enable` directives at lower levels.

When tracing is disabled, no span is created when a request is handled, and no
trace context is propagated to proxied services.

Datadog tracing is enabled by default.  This directive is the way to disable
it.

### `datadog_resource_name`

- **syntax** `datadog_resource_name <name>`
- **default**: `$request_method $uri`, e.g. "GET /api/book/0-345-24223-8/title"
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Set the request span's "resource name" (sometimes called "endpoint") to the
result of evaluating the specified `<name>` in the context of the current
request. `<name>` is a string that may contain `$`-[variables][2] (including
those provided by this module).

The request span is the span created while processing a request.

### `datadog_location_resource_name`

- **syntax** `datadog_location_resource_name <name>`
- **default**: `$request_method $uri`, e.g. "GET /api/book/0-345-24223-8/title"
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Set the location span's "resource name" (sometimes called "endpoint") to the
result of evaluating the specified `<name>` in the context of the current
request. `<name>` is a string that may contain `$`-[variables][2] (including
those provided by this module).

The location span is a span created in addition to the request span.  See
`datadog_trace_locations`.

### `datadog_trust_incoming_span`

- **syntax** `datadog_trust_incoming_span on|off`
- **default**: `on`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

If `on`, attempt to extract trace context from incoming requests.  This way,
nginx need not be the beginning of the trace â€” it can inherit a parent span
from the incoming request.

If `off`, trace context will not be extracted from incoming requests.  Nginx
will start a new trace.  This might be desired if extracting trace information
from untrusted clients is deemed a security concern.

### `datadog_propagation_styles`
- **syntax** `datadog_propagation_styles <style> [<style> ...]`
- **default**: `tracecontext datadog`
- **context**: `http`

Set one or more trace propagation styles that nginx will use to extract trace
context from incoming requests and to inject trace context into outgoing
requests.

When extracting trace context from an incoming request, the specified styles
will be tried in order, stopping at the first style that yields trace context.

When injecting trace context into an outgoing request, all of the specified
styles will be used.

The following styles are supported:

- `datadog` is the Datadog style.  It uses the following headers:
    - X-Datadog-Trace-Id
    - X-Datadog-Parent-Id
    - X-Datadog-Sampling-Priority
    - X-Datadog-Origin
    - X-Datadog-Tags
- `tracecontext` is the W3C (OpenTelemetry) style.  It uses the following headers:
    - traceparent
    - tracestate
- `b3` is the Zipkin multi-header style.  It uses the following headers:
    - X-B3-TraceId
    - X-B3-SpanId
    - X-B3-Sampled

### `datadog_operation_name`

- **syntax** `datadog_operation_name <name>`
- **default**: `nginx.request`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Set the request span's "operation name" to the result of evaluating the
specified `<name>` in the context of the current request. `<name>` is a string
that may contain `$`-[variables][2] (including those provided by this module).

The request span is the span created while processing a request.

### `datadog_location_operation_name`

- **syntax** `datadog_location_operation_name <name>`
- **default**: `nginx.$datadog_proxy_directive`, e.g. `nginx.proxy_pass`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

Set the location span's "operation name" to the result of evaluating the
specified `<name>` in the context of the current request. `<name>` is a string
that may contain `$`-[variables][2] (including those provided by this module).

The location span is a span created in addition to the request span.  See
`datadog_trace_locations`.

### `datadog_trace_locations`

- **syntax** `datadog_trace_locations on|off`
- **default**: `off`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

If `on`, then in addition to creating one span per request handled, create an
additional span representing the `location` block selected in handling the
request.

This option is `off` by default, so that only one span is produced per request.

### `datadog_allow_sampling_delegation_in_subrequests`

- **syntax** `datadog_allow_sampling_delegation_in_subrequests [on|off]`
- **default**: `off`
- **context**: `http`, `server`, `location`

If `on`, then honor `datadog_delegate_sampling` directives in contexts where
nginx is making a subrequest, e.g. with the `auth_request` directive.

This option is `off` by default, so that sampling delegation is not performed
for subrequests.

Note that in addition to this directive, the nginx configuration must also
contain the `log_subrequest on;` directive in order for tracing to be enabled
for subrequests.

### `datadog_appsec_enabled` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_enabled [on|off]`
- **default**: `off`
- **context**: `main`

Controls whether AppSec can be used in requests (provided that the request is
mapped to a thread pool).

A basic but full example of a configuration file that enables AppSec is:

```nginx
thread_pool waf_thread_pool threads=2 max_queue=16;

load_module /path/to/ngx_http_datadog_module.so;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    datadog_agent_url http://agent:8126;
    datadog_appsec_enabled on;
    datadog_waf_thread_pool_name waf_thread_pool;

    server {
        listen 80;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend:8080;
        }
    }
}
```

### `datadog_waf_thread_pool_name` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_waf_thread_pool_name <pool name>`
- **default**: (undefined)
- **context**: `main`, `server`, `location`

AppSec runs its core logic in a separate thread in order to avoid blocking the
main thread as much as possible. This directive controls the thread pool where
the task is dispatched to. The thread pool must have been defined with the nginx
[`thread_pool`][3] directive. If a request is not mapped to any thread pool,
AppSec checks will not run.

### `datadog_appsec_ruleset_file` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_ruleset_file <path to json rules file>`
- **default**: (undefined: embedded rules are run)
- **context**: `main`

Allows replacing the embedded rules file with a custom one.

### `datadog_appsec_http_blocked_template_json` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_http_blocked_template_json <path to json file>`
- **default**: (undefined: default response is sent)
- **context**: `main`

When AppSec blocks a request, this directive controls the response the server
will send, provided that content negotiation results in a json response.

### `datadog_appsec_http_blocked_template_html` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_http_blocked_template_html <path to html file>`
- **default**: (undefined: default response is sent)
- **context**: `main`

When AppSec blocks a request, this directive controls the response the server
will send, provided that content negotiation results in an html response.

### `datadog_client_ip_header` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_client_ip_header <name of header with IP address>`
- **default**: (undefined: a predefined set of headers are checked, plus the
  peer address)
- **context**: `main`

Controls which header is used to determine the real client IP address. The value
may contain uppercase and underscore characters; these are normalized to their
lowercase counterparts and the dash character, respectively.

It is recommended that this header be set in order to avoid IP address spoofing.

### `datadog_appsec_waf_timeout` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_waf_timeout <int><unit>`
- **default**: 100ms
- **context**: `main`

The approximate maximum execution time for each WAF run. The run will exit early
should this limit be exceeded.

### `datadog_appsec_obfuscation_key_regex` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_obfuscation_key_regex <regular expression>`
- **default**: `(?i)(?:p(?:ass)?w(?:or)?d|pass(?:_?phrase)?|secret|(?:api_?|private_?|public_?)key)|token|consumer_?(?:id|key|secret)|sign(?:ed|ature)|bearer|authorization`
- **context**: `main`

Values associated with a key matching this regular expression will be redacted.

### `datadog_appsec_obfuscation_value_regex` (AppSec builds)

- **syntax** `datadog_appsec_obfuscation_key_regex <regular expression>`
- **default**: (undefined)
- **context**: `main`

Values matching this regular expression will be redacted.


Variables
---------
Nginx defines [variables][2] that may appear in various contexts in the nginx
configuration and at runtime evaluate to values of interest, such as the
request "User-Agent" header (`$http_user_agent`).

The Datadog nginx module defines additional variables that provide information
about the currently active trace.

### `datadog_trace_id`
`$datadog_trace_id` expands to the decimal representation of the unsigned
64-bit ID of the currently active trace. If there is no currently active
trace, then the variable expands to a hyphen character (`-`) instead.

### `datadog_span_id`
`$datadog_span_id` expands to the decimal representation of the unsigned 64-bit
ID of the currently active span.If there is no currently active span, then
the variable expands to a hyphen character (`-`) instead.

Note that if `datadog_trace_locations` is `on`, then `$datadog_span_id` will
refer to the span associated with the location (outbound request), not its
parent (inbound request).

### `datadog_trace_id_hex`
Same as `$datadog_trace_id`, but is the hexadecimal representation of the 128-bit ID. 

### `datadog_span_id_hex`
Same as `$datadog_span_id`, but is the hexadecimal representation.

### `datadog_location`
`$datadog_location` expands to the name or pattern of the `location` block that
matched the current request.  For example,

    location /foo {
        # ...
    }

has location name "/foo", while

    location ~ /api/v(1|2)/trace/[0-9]+ {
        # ...
    }

has location name "`/api/v(1|2)/trace/[0-9]+`".

Named locations have their literal names, including the "@", e.g.

    location @updates {
        # ...
    }

has location name "@updates".

If there is no location associated with the current request, then
`$datadog_location` expands to a hyphen character ("-").

### `datadog_proxy_directive`
`$datadog_proxy_directive` expands to the name of the configuration directive
used to proxy the current request, i.e. one of `proxy_pass`, `grpc_pass`,
`fastcgi_pass`, or `uwsgi_pass`.

If the request was not configured by one of those directives, then
`$datadog_proxy_directive` expands to "`location`".

This variable is used in the implementation of the Datadog nginx module.

### `datadog_json`
`$datadog_json` expands to a JSON object of trace context.  Each of its
properties corresponds to the value of a header that would be used to propagate
trace context to a proxied service.

If there is no currently active trace, then the variable expands to a hyphen
character (`-`) instead.

### `datadog_config_json`
`$datadog_config_json` expands to a JSON object whose properties describe the
configuration of the Datadog tracer.  It is the same as the JSON object logged
to standard error when the tracer is initialized.

If tracing is disabled, then the variable expands to a hyphen character (`-`)
instead.

### `datadog_env_*`
`$datadog_env_<var>` expands to the value of the specified `<var>` environment
variable.  `<var>` must be one of the environment variables used to configure
the Datadog tracer.

If `<var>` is not one of the allowed variables, or if `<var>` is not defined in
the environment, then the variable expands to a hyphen character (`-`) instead.

This family of variables is used in the tests for the Datadog nginx module.

### `datadog_auth_request_hook`
This is an implementation detail of the module and should not be used.
