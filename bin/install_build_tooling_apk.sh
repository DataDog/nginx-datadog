# Build a recent cmake from source.  We need at least 3.12, but ubuntu 18
# packages 3.10.
# Version 3.12 or newer is needed because version 3.12 added the ability to
# associated link libraries with OBJECT targets.  OBJECT targets don't link
# anything (they just produce .o files), but the idea is that link dependencies
# are inherited by targets that eventually will link the produced object files.

# cmake likes to have openssl and Linux headers available
